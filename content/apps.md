# Keybuild

Build your own keyboard!

Touchscreen keyboards don't need to be one-size-fits-all, so let's change that! With Keybuild, you choose the layout, the keys, everything.

Keys can be set up to type whatever you want! Letters, greek letters (ɑ, β, ɣ), maths symbols (π, ∫, ∑), arrows (↑→↓←), or even your favourite emoji can be added and organised depending on your needs.

Create multiple ‘panes’, each containing keys arranged using a stack-based layout, and switch between them with either an automatic menu, or direct links.

Add a small number row to your Qwerty keyboard, or have a try using Azerty or Colemak layouts. Build a keyboard that can keep up with your maths-heavy university course, or specialist profession. Or just make a dashboard for your favourite emoji. Or do all that and more, it's up to you!

# Medlied - Media Library & Editor

Medlied is an app for managing your local music & video library of MP3 and MP4 files, with support for editing file metadata via long-press / right click. Music can be added to the queue from your library, or from external sources, with options to shuffle and loop tracks.

Designed to avoid the need to use a Mac to edit one’s local library, edits can be made in-place, and files can be stored anywhere.

Editable file metadata currently includes Title, Album, Artist, Track and Disk Numbers, Artwork, and Lyrics. Unchanged metadata will be preserved when editing.
