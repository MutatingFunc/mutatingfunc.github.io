I have opinions. 🐣

## Windowing
* There’s no weird distinction between maximised and fullscreen windows. (And let’s not get into how some apps don’t maximise, but [“zoom”](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253459042))
* We don’t work all the time, and iPadOS defaults every app to be fullscreen by default when Stage Manager is disabled. 👌
    * In comparison, macOS just makes a mess if you do the same, and still opts to waste 80% of your screen by default.
* Where in macOS a window would get lost behind another, iPadOS lets windows peek out from behind like a tab, ready for further use. This encourages layering of windows, where macOS would discourage!
* iPadOS snaps windows to a neat & orderly grid, with enough snap guides that you can still size for exactly as much content as you want, so everything looks clean and you can get on with work.
    * With macOS, you’d better be ready to whip out a magnifying glass to avoid adjacent windows having a 3 pixel height difference.

## Design
* The animations are so good… ✨
* The cursor is a nice and symmetric circle, clearly defining the interaction to perform. Not a miniature cap for a zebra! 🦓
    * Don’t like the pointer effects? You can turn them off in Settings!
    * “Oh, but I need pixel-perfect precision” - No, you don’t. If you’re using your cursor for this, you’re doing it wrong. Apps have snap guides and text fields for this sort of thing.
* Minimal window chrome, and windows adopt an iPhone-style compact layout when small!

## Power-user features
* Shortcuts automations. Amazing utility on iPadOS, missing on macOS. Admittedly, 3rd party options are available on macOS for a price, or a good deal of time.
    * What are automation triggers good for? Try pairing dark mode with Do Not Disturb for use in lectures, making your text size larger at night, or playing a startup chime when connecting your external display! 🎵
* iPadOS’s share menu has useful options like “Copy” and “Save to Files”. It’s also a powerhouse when loaded with custom-made Shortcuts.
    * On macOS, you sometimes have to break context to save content from an app to the filesystem, or depending on the app you may have to add it to the filesystem to get it into a Shortcut!
* Native iPhone apps. But all of them, with touch, not like in macOS where 99% of developers opt-out and many of the rest don’t work.. macOS just has variations on windowing and spaces

## Hardware
* Rear-facing camera, good for grabbing the diagram from a slide when taking notes!
* Touchscreen.
* Detachable screen for content consumption.
* Apple Pencil support.
* Wonky side-on camera, yes, but it’s at crystal-clear resolution!

## A case for macOS
* Offline backups to external drives. Backing up your iCloud-synced files to iCloud is not a backup at all! Macs are currently a backup-making device, first and foremost.
* If you’re a developer, IDEs exist beyond Playgrounds. At least until Apple releases CompilerKit, their ‘more secure’ take on code generation which meets App Store guidelines, and/or get round to an Xcode rebuild using a SwiftPM-based project format prototyped in Playgrounds
* Accessibility APIs so you can use window managers as a crutch for your subpar windowing experience.
* Command line… Are you _sure_ you couldn’t do the same stuff just as fast with a UI designed for humans, theoretically? Keyboard shortcuts are generally faster than typing words.
* \[Your niche use-case here]
